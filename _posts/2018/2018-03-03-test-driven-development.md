Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must write a test that fails before you write new functional code.

**Workflow**
1. Write a failing test
2. Write code to make it pass.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
4. Along the way, refactor aggressively.
5. When you can't think of any more tests, you must be done.
