If dhcp server assign ip based on MAC, Fedora 24 client can&#8217;t get the right IP.

Root cause: After fresh install Fedora 24, there is no /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf. Not sure what Network Manger does to acquire IP addess.

Solution: CreateÂ /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

~~~shell
$ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

send dhcp-client-identifier = hardware;

~~~
