Our database has more then 42 millions records. We need to create report for differnt roles.
I prefer opensource BI since we can build the website on our own server and access data directly.

## Excel Pivot Table
* Prop: 
  * Very easy to use
  * Support dashboard
  * No sql needed

* Cons:
  * Single desktop application
  * Only support 1 million rows
  * Cannot access our database directly
  * Diffcult to update data

## [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* Prop:
  * Very easy to user
  * Support dashboard
  * Has multiple version: Desktop, Cloud, and Mobile app.

* Cons:
  * Cannot access our database directly
  * Each people has his only account. It is not sharable.
  * Not free.

## [BIRT](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/) and [BIRT iHub F-Type](https://sourceforge.net/projects/birtihubftype/?source=typ_redirect)
* Prop:
  * Opensource
  * Suppor J2EE application
  * We have an issue to access
