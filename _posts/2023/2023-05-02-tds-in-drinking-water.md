## What is TDS?

TDS stand for Total Dissolved Solids (总溶解固体), and it could reflect the level of contamination in water supply. TDS represents the mineral content in the water.


### Common Dissolved Solids

* Calcium 钙 
* Magnesium 镁 
* Sodium 钠
* Potassium 钾 
* Bicarbonate 碳酸氢
* Chloride 氯
* Sulfates 硫酸盐
* Organic matter 有机物质

### TDS Levels by Taste

* TDS Less Than 300: It should taste fine
* TDS 300 to 600: The water should taste ok
* TDS 600 to 900: The water may teste salty
* TDS Over 900: The water will taste bad

### TDS Levels by Health

* TDS Less than 50: This is too low because the water does not have enough nutrients and minerals
* TDS 50 to 150: The water is safe to drink with some nutritional value
* TDS 150 to 250: This is the optimal goal
* TDS 250 to 500: The water is safe to drink
* TDS Over 500: A water filter is needed to reduce the TDS reading
