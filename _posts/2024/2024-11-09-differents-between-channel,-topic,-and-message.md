## Channel

* In context of IBM MQ, a channel is a communication link used to connect MQ clients and queue managers. It defines the characteristics of a connection (like protocol, port, etc.).
* For Kafka, channels aren't really a concept. Kafka focuses more on producers, consumers, and brokers for communication.

## Topic

* In IBM MQ, the term topic is also used but the context of the publish/subscribe model, where message are published to a topic and then delivered to all subscribers of that topic.
* For Kafka, a topic is a category/feed name to which messages are sent by producers. Consumers read messages for topics. Think of it as a *folder* for messages.

## Message

* In both Kafka and IBM MQ, a message is the unit of communication, essentially the data that gets sent between systems. It can include information like payload, headers, and metadata.
* In Kafka, messages are key-value pairs and are stored in topics. Producers send messages to topics, and consumers read messages from them.
* In IBM MQ, messages can be placed in queue (point-to-point) or topics (publish/subscribe).
