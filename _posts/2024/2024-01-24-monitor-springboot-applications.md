## Monitoring Tools

Monitoring Spring Boot applications is essential for ensuring their health, performance, and responsiveness. There are several tools and techniques which can monitor a Spring Boot application:

* **Spring Boot Actuator**
  * Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in support for monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications. It exposes various endpoints that offer insights into the application's health, metrics, environment, and more.
  * Common Actuator endpoints include `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/info`, etc.
  * To enable Actuator, include the `Spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency in the project, and configure endpoints in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

* **Spring Boot Admin**
  * Spring Boot Admin is a community project that provides a web-based UI for monitoring Spring Boot applications.
  * It aggregates information from Actuator endpoints and presents it in a easy-to-use interface.
  * To use Spring Boot Admin, include the `spring-boot-admin-starter-server` dependency to the project.

* **Prometheus and Grafana**
  * Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
  * Integrating Spring Boot with Prometheus involves adding the `micrometer-registry-prometheus` dependency and configuring Prometheus properties.
  * Grafana can be used alongside Prometheus to visualize and analyze metrics data.
