## Authentication Protocols

* Kerberos
* LDAP
* OAuth2
* SAML
* Radius

## Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

Digital signature standard is a Federated Information Processing Standard (FIPS) which defines algorithms that are used to generate digital signature with the help of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). For the authentication of electronic documents, DDS only provides us with the digital signature function and not with any encryption or key exchanging strategies.

* Sender Side
    * Original message (M)
    * Hashcode (H)
    * A random number (k)
    * A private key of sender
    * A global public key

The message body will include the original message concatenated with the signature. The signature contains two components - 's' and 'r'.

* Reciver Side
    * The hashcode generated by the receiver
    * Signature components 's' and 'r'
    * Public key of the sender
    * Global public key

## Authentication Methods

* Certificate-based authentication
* Kerberos-based authentication
* OpenID-Oauth authentication
* PAM_JAAS authentication
* SMAL authentication
