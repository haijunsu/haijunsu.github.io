## Introduce yourself, what excites you?
My name is Haijun Su. You can call me Navy. Navy is Oldnavy. Now I am working as a system administrator at Research Foundation of CUNY. My duty is not only to manager servers and mantain networks. I also created a website FAST(nycfast.info) for the New York City Mayor's Office of Environmental Remediation, and I am developing another website, CUNY Energy. I also created a private cloud environment for Tech Incubator at Queens College. Before I came America, I worked for Ericsson (China) and Nortel Networks (China). I focused on two major projects: Common security and Desktop framework for OAM and OAM System Monitor for CNM. I worte the backend framework for Common security and Desktop framework for OAM. I also wrote a prototype and a framework for OAM System Monitor for CNM. I submited two patents and obtained top 10 employee rewards at Ericsson. Most languages I used are Java, python, PHP, and Shell Scripts. I have SCJP and MCSE certificates. 

## Why Amazon?
A. It is a big decision to change job for me and I always do it very carefully. I am not only consider about whether the company is great. My main concerns are whether I can fit the position, what I can contribute it, and what I can learn from it.
The position, Software Development Engineer - AWS Device Farm, is part of AWS service. I love cloud technologies and I am building a private cloud environment for Tech Incubator at Queens College. I really want to be a member who can contribute some cloud productions. It is an honor to work with a team which contributes AWS service. I have experiences on creating prototype, writing framework, working with architecture and customers. I like the centence in job description that every team members are involved participating in production definition, technical aarchitecture review, iterative development, code reviews and operations. I think it is the place where I can contribute my talent to the product and I can grow my technical skills with team members.

## Describe an interesting problem and how you solved it.
For technical issue, I will do research first including collecting environment variables, clarify the problem and how to reproduce it. If there is no enough time to do reseach or I cannot find the solution, I will ask my team members to help. If the problem impacts the schedule, I will report to manager.

## Have you ever disagreed with a manager's decision, and how did you approach the disagreement? Give a specific example and explain how you rectified this disagreement, what the final outcome was, and how that individual would describe you today.
